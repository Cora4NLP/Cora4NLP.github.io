abstract: "There  has  been  a  significant  progress  in  thefield of extractive question answering (EQA)in  the  recent  years.   However,  most  of  themrely on annotations of answer-spans in the cor-responding  passages.    In  this  work,  we  ad-dress  the  problem  of  EQA  when  no  annotations  are  present  for  the  answer  span,  i.e.,when the dataset contains only questions andcorresponding passages.  Our method is basedon auto-encoding of the question that performsa question answering (QA) task during encoding and a question generation (QG) task duringdecoding. Our method performs well in a zero-shot setting and can provide an additional lossto boost performance for EQA."
