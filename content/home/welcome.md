Language is implicit — it omits information. Filling this information gap requires contextual inference, background- and commonsense knowledge, and reasoning over situational context. Language also evolves, i.e., it specializes and changes over time. For example, many different languages and domains exist, new domains arise, and both evolve constantly. Thus, language understanding also requires continuous and efficient adaptation to new languages and domains — and transfer to, and between, both. Current language understanding methods, however, focus on high resource languages and domains, use little to no context, and assume static data, task, and target distributions.

The research in Cora4NLP aims to address these challenges. It builds on the expertise and results of the predecessor project [DEEPLEE](https://www.deeplee.de) and is carried out jointly between DFKI's language technology research departments in [Berlin](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology/) and [Saarbrücken](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology/). Specifically, our goal is to develop natural language understanding methods that enable:

- reasoning over broader co- and contexts
- efficient adaptation to novel and/or low resource contexts
- continual adaptation to, and generalization over, evolving contexts

Cora4NLP is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under funding code 01IW20010.
