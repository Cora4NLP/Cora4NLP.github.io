One paper from Cora4NLP authors has been accepted for publication at [CoNLL 2022](https://conll.org/2022), the SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning. The conference is co-located with EMNLP 2022 and planned to be a hybrid meeting. It will take place in Abu Dhabi, from Dec 7th to Dec 8th, 2022. The paper introduces [HinDialect](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-4839), a new corpus of 26 Hindi dialects, and presents a new method for cognate induction with low-resource languages.
